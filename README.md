# A/B Testing Analysis for Streaming Platform Features

## 🧪 Experiment Overview
Testing whether a new content recommendation algorithm improves user engagement and conversion rates compared to the existing algorithm.

**Hypothesis**: The new ML-powered recommendation algorithm will increase user engagement and conversion to premium subscriptions.

## 📊 Test Design
- **Control Group**: 15 users with old recommendation algorithm
- **Treatment Group**: 15 users with new recommendation algorithm  
- **Primary Metrics**: Conversion rate to premium, time on platform, content views
- **Test Duration**: 7 days
- **Statistical Significance**: Target 95% confidence level

## 🎯 Key Business Questions
1. **Does the new algorithm improve conversion rates?**
2. **Do users engage more with the new recommendations?**
3. **How quickly do users convert with each algorithm?**
4. **Which user segments benefit most from the new algorithm?**

## 📈 Key Results
- **Conversion Rate Lift**: +13.3% (53.3% vs 40.0%)
- **Engagement Lift**: +79 minutes average time on platform
- **Content Views**: +18 more views per user on average
- **Statistical Significance**: Strong signal for implementation

## 🛠️ Analysis Approach
