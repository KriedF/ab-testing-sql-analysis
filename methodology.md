# A/B Testing Methodology

## Experimental Design

### Test Setup
- **Random Assignment**: Users randomly assigned to control/treatment groups
- **Sample Size**: 30 total users (15 per group)
- **Test Duration**: 7-day observation period
- **Primary Success Metric**: Conversion to premium subscription

### Statistical Assumptions
- **Independence**: User behaviors assumed independent of each other
- **Random Sampling**: Users represent broader platform population
- **Minimum Effect Size**: Targeting 10%+ conversion rate improvement for business significance

## Data Collection

### Metrics Tracked
- **Binary Outcome**: Conversion (0/1)
- **Engagement Metrics**: Time on platform, content views
- **Timing Data**: Days from test start to conversion
- **User Context**: Signup date for cohort analysis

### Data Quality Checks
- No missing user_id values
- Consistent date formatting across all records
- Logical data validation (e.g., converted users have conversion_date)

## Statistical Analysis Approach

### Significance Testing
- **Method**: Two-proportion z-test for conversion rates
- **Confidence Level**: 95% (Î± = 0.05)
- **Power**: Targeting 80% power to detect meaningful differences
- **Multiple Comparisons**: Single primary metric to avoid p-hacking

### Business Significance Thresholds
- **Conversion Rate**: Minimum 5% absolute improvement for implementation
- **Engagement**: Minimum 15% relative improvement in time on platform
- **Sample Size**: Minimum 20 users total for preliminary conclusions

## Limitations & Assumptions

### Sample Size Limitations
- Small sample (30 users) limits statistical power
- Real implementation would require 200+ users per group
- Results should be considered directional rather than definitive

### Time Period Considerations
- 7-day test may not capture longer-term user behavior changes
- Seasonal effects not accounted for in analysis
- New user bias (all users relatively new to platform)

### External Validity
- Test population may not represent all user segments
- Algorithm performance could vary by content catalog changes
- Results may not generalize to different user acquisition channels

## Recommendations for Future Testing

### Improved Experimental Design
1. **Larger Sample Sizes**: 500+ users per group for adequate power
2. **Longer Test Duration**: 14-28 days to capture behavior patterns
3. **Stratified Randomization**: Balance groups by key user characteristics
4. **Multiple Success Metrics**: Primary + secondary metrics with adjustment for multiple testing

### Advanced Analytics
1. **Bayesian A/B Testing**: For more nuanced probability statements
2. **Sequential Testing**: Allow for early stopping with proper controls
3. **Heterogeneous Treatment Effects**: Analyze results by user segments
4. **Long-term Impact**: Track 30, 60, 90-day outcomes post-test
